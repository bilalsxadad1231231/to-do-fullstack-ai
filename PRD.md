- Provide a modern, responsive user experience
- Implement real-time features and persistent storage

### Target Users
- Individual users managing personal tasks
- Developers evaluating AI integration capabilities
- Assessment evaluators reviewing technical skills

### Core Features

#### 1. Todo Management
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Basic CRUD operations for todo items

**Requirements:**
- Create new todo items with title, description, priority, and due date
- View all todo items in a list format
- Mark todo items as completed/incomplete
- Delete todo items
- Edit existing todo items

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [x] Todos are displayed in a clean, organized list
- [x] Completed todos show visual indicators (strikethrough, color changes)
- [x] Todos persist across browser sessions
- [x] Form validation prevents invalid submissions

#### 2. AI-Powered Subtask Generation
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Automatically generate relevant subtasks using AI

**Requirements:**
- Generate 3-5 subtasks for each todo item
- Use AI to analyze todo content and create contextually relevant subtasks

- [x] Subtasks can be marked as completed
- [x] Loading states during AI generation
- [x] Error handling for AI service failures

#### 3. Multi-Language Translation
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Translate todo items to user-defined languages

**Requirements:**
- Allow users to specify target language (not restricted to predefined list)
- Translate todo title and description
- Provide real-time translation with loading states
- Handle translation errors gracefully
- Display original and translated text

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Users can input any target language
- [x] Translation works for todo titles and descriptions
- [x] Loading indicators during translation
- [x] Error messages for unsupported languages
- [x] Clean UI for displaying translations

#### 4. User Interface & Experience
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Modern, responsive, and intuitive user interface

**Requirements:**
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Modern, clean UI with consistent styling
- Real-time feedback and notifications
- Intuitive navigation and interactions
- Accessibility considerations

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Application works on mobile and desktop
- [x] Consistent design language throughout
- [x] Toast notifications for user feedback
- [x] Smooth animations and transitions
- [x] Clear visual hierarchy

### Technical Requirements

#### Backend Requirements
- **Framework:** FastAPI for API development
- **Database:** SQLite for data persistence
- **AI Integration:** Groq LLM for intelligent features

- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for rapid development
- **State Management:** React Context for global state
- **Form Handling:** React Hook Form for validation
- **HTTP Client:** Axios for API communication
- **Deployment:** Vercel for frontend hosting

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
- Page load time < 3 seconds
- API response time < 500ms
- AI feature response time < 5 seconds
- Support for 100+ concurrent users

#### Security
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
- Environment variable management
- No sensitive data in client-side code

#### Reliability
- 99% uptime target
- Graceful error handling
- Fallback mechanisms for AI services
- Data persistence and backup

#### Usability
- Intuitive user interface
- Responsive design for all devices
- Clear error messages
- Loading states for better UX

### Success Metrics
- [x] All core features implemented and functional
- [x] Application deployed and accessible online
- [x] Code is clean, modular, and well-documented
- [x] AI features work reliably
- [x] User interface is modern and responsive
- [x] Application handles errors gracefully

### Future Enhancements
- User authentication and accounts
- Todo categories and tags
- Advanced filtering and search
- Collaborative todo sharing
- Mobile app development
- Advanced AI features (task prioritization, time estimation)

### Constraints
- 4-hour development time limit
- Single developer implementation
- AI service dependency (Groq)
- Deployment on Vercel platform

### Risk Assessment
